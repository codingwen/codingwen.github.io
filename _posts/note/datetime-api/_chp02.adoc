- ``java.time``: date, time, date and time combined, time zones, instants, duration, and clocks.
- ``java.time.chrono``: API for representing calendar systems other than ISO-8601. Several predefined chronologies are provided and you can also define your own chronology.
- ``java.time.format``: Classes for formatting and parsing dates and time
- ``java.time.temporal``: Extended API, primarily for framework and library writers, allowing interoperations between the date and time classes, querying, and adjustment. Fields and units are defined in this package.
- ``java.time.zone``: Classes that support time zones, offsets from time zones, and time zone rules.

== Design Principles

- clear
- fluent
- immutable
- extensible

== Method Naming Conventions

由于大多数class是immutable的，因此没有set方法。下表列出了一些常用的方法前缀

|===
| Prefix 
| Method Type 
| Use

| ``of`` 
| static factory 
| Creates an instance where the factory is primarily validating the input parameters, not converting them

|``from`` 
| static factory 
| Converts the input parameters to an instance of the target class, which may involve losing information from the input

|``parse`` 
| static factory 
| Parses the input string to produce an instance of the target class

|``format`` 
| instance 
| Uses the specified formatter to format the values in the temporal object to produce a string

|``get`` 
| instance 
| Returns a part of the state of the target object

|``is`` 
| instance 
| Queries the state of the target object

|``with`` 
| instance 
| Returns a copy of the target object with one element changed; this is the immutable equivalent to a set method on a JavaBean

|``plus`` 
| instance 
| Returns a copy of the target object with an amount of time added

|``minus`` 
| instance 
| Returns a copy of the target object with an amount of time subtracted

|``to`` 
| instance 
| Converts this object to another type

|``at`` 
| instance 
| Combines this object with another.
